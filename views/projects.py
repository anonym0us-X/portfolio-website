st.subheader("1. Thundermat")
st.write("""This was my first year PBL i.e the project based learning project. As a first year student we were not much technical but still wanted to do something related to the computer field.
         then we realized the problem of the over heating in the devices like the mobiles, laptops. We saw the potential solutions the cooling pads. But we werent happy with the result and thought of improving the cooling. And we introduced the thundermat.
         In the project we made use of the cooling pads. These pads created a cool air flow which was then directed to the device. 
         \nThis was done using the fans which were placed at center of the frame and the cooling pads along the frame. This resulted in a better cooling of the device.
         We had filed copyright of the project and it was granted to us.

st.write("""This was my second year project which was focused on the road safety. 
         It was a mini project competetion held in out college where we did present it. And we made up to the second position in the competetion!
         \nBasically the project was a hardware and software mixed project. We made use of Arduino UNO board with a sonar sensor which acted as the radar sensor. The sensor was used to detect the distance of the vehicle from the obstacle. 
         And the data collected was analyzed for the alerting the driver of the cautions.

st.write("""I started learning react and wanted to get some in-depth knowledge of it. So I decided to make a simple dictionary app using react.
         \nThis was my first react project. I made use of the API of dictionary to get the definitions of the words.
         \nI have posted this project on the GitHub please check it out. [Dictionary app](https://github.com/anonym0us-X/Dictionary-app)
